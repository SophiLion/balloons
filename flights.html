                <p>Enjoy our two hour afternoon flight. See Ambleside's major tourist attractions from the air, including Stock Ghyll Force, a spectacular 70 foot waterfall. In the spring the area under the trees is a carpet of daffodils. There used to be 12 watermills driven by the power of Stock Ghyll and other local becks. The 17th Century Bridge House over Stock Ghyll is one of the most photographed scenes in Lakeland.</p>

                <p>The Grasmere Lake tour includes a trip to The Gingerbread Shop after we land. Grasmere Gingerbread was invented in 1854 by Victorian cook Sarah Nelson who baked her spicy-sweet chewy concoction inside her Church Cottage home – now The Grasmere Gingerbread Shop – and sold it to villagers and visitors from a tree stump outside her front door.</p>

                <p>Night landings are always very exciting as we float down over the beautiful mountains and lakes to land softly in the fells where you will be greeted with champagne and foie gras. We have two night flights. This one flies over picturesque Tarn Hows and Coniston. Contact us for group rates.</p>
